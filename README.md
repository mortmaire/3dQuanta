# 3dQuanta

Project of description many-dimensional quantum systems in C++. For the beginning I'm trying to obtain quantum harmonic oscillator in 2d, after this I'll find higher energetic states and make a description for system degeneration (many values of angular momentum for one eigenvalue of hamiltonian). 

Next step will be transport system to 3d and make full description of degeneraton (L^2, L_z). Also, because my system won't be always radial, I need to find more general method to find CSCO (Complete System of Commuting Operators).
